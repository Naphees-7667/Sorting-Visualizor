# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help users understand and visualize the functioning of popular sorting algorithms. The project dynamically renders arrays and provides real-time visual feedback during the sorting process, making learning algorithms more engaging and intuitive.

## Features

- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Real-Time Feedback:** Visual representation of array element swaps and comparisons during the sorting process.

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Generate new arrays of random sizes and values.
  - Adjust the speed of visualization.
  - Start, pause, or reset sorting animations.

- **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices, including desktops and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key Techniques:**
  - DOM Manipulation
  - Asynchronous Programming with `async/await`
  - Event Listeners for user interactions
  - Modular code structure for scalability and maintainability

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naphees-7667/Sorting-Visualizor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Generate a random array by clicking the "Generate Array" button.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Adjust the speed slider as needed.
5. Click the "Start Sorting" button to visualize the selected algorithm in action.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the working principles of common sorting algorithms.
- Observe performance differences between algorithms through visual feedback.
- Learn how to implement algorithms using JavaScript.

## Project Highlights

- **Asynchronous Animations:** Utilized `setTimeout` and `async/await` to ensure smooth and non-blocking animations during sorting.
- **Event Loop and Promises:** Managed user interactions and ensured consistent execution using JavaScript's event loop and promises.
- **Maintainability:** Adopted modular coding practices to facilitate easy updates and scalability.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort).
- Include performance metrics like time complexity and space complexity for each algorithm.
- Allow users to input custom arrays for sorting.
